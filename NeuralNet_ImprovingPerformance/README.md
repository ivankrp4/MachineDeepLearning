### Several techniques for improving the performance of a neural net model are examined.

As an example, I consider a deep learning image classifier.

The following techniques are implemented and discussed:

1. Choosing an optimal train-test split on the data set.
2. Batch normalization for the layer outputs.
3. Dropout regularization technique.
4. Data augmentation/generation for images (using a photo of Celine Dion as an example).
