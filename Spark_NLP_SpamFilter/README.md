### In this code I apply the tools of MLlib (Apache Spark's scalable machine learning library) to a NLP classification problem.

The program is aimed at classifying SMS messages as either ham or spam based on the corpus of labelled SMS messages. 

The main purpose of this project is to show the feature transformations needed to be done on text data before machine learning algorithms (for instance, a Naive Bayes classifier) can be applied.
