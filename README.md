### My portfolio of selected machine learning and deep learning implementations (in Python). 

The problems addressed encompass different types of regression, classification, NLP (natural language processing), image recognition, and time series tasks.

Most of the programs are implemented via neural networks (NN), notably Fully Connected NN, Convolutional NN (notably LSTM layers), and Recurrent NN architectures.

Special attention is devoted to model optimization solutions, such as regularization techniques (dropout regularization, batch normalization), embedding (for text data), hyperparameter optimization, and data augmentation.

The main tools include 

- Standard Python libraries for data visualiazation, transformation, and analysis:
	* Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn (Python library for machine learning and exploratory data analysis)
- Keras API for deep learning
- MLlib (Apache Spark's scalable machine learning library)  

More detail can be found in the respective README files for each project.
